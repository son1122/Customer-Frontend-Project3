<h2>My Planing Step</h2>

<h3>1. List All requirement and draw a Wireframe</h3>
Let's thingking about what user want from POS throught User Stories 

<h3> User Stories </h3>

<ul>
  <li>As a User I want to have an account for my store *Note User repersent shop owner who use POS system</li>
  <li>As a User I want my app to have two main page such as order page and table page or more</li>
  <li>As a User I want to have  a menu page to select and create order for my custommer.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my menu page able to edit and delete my order detail.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my menu page able select Table number</li>
  <li>As a User I want to view all menu that sent from database.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my menu filtered by cattagory.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my table page to be click able and show order detail for each table</li>
  <li>As a user I want to check out my app can update status to data base </li>
  <li>As a POS App I want ability to search by menu name.</li> 
  <li>As a POS App I want ability to create and update data from database </li>  
</ul>

<h3> Wireframe </h3>
  We sperate in two part for wire frame
  
  <p>part 1 Frontend wire frame, For login page, Order Page, Table Page. We use the same design for both order and Table </p>

  part 2 Database wire frame, we use ERd to draw main table first and add more deatil for dash board and so on

<h3>2. make a List of technical difficulties and study all of them</h3>

<ul>
  <li>sequelize</li>
  <li>node js</li>
  <li>git comman</li>
  <li>html, css,  java script</li>
  <li>react</li>
  <li>react ant design</li>
  <li>react spinner</li>
  <li>psql</li>
  <li>figma</li>
  <li>bootstrap</li>
</ul>


<h3>3. make a simple step plan</h3>

Spilt to three part frontend, database in bit.io, sequelize in backend. To see how data is flow we create flow chart and sequence diagram you can see in this pdf
[sequence_diagram_Order.pdf](https://github.com/son1122/Customer-Frontend-Project3/files/10338837/sequence_diagram_Order.pdf)


<h4>Front POS react app</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Order page

  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h4>Backend database</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Make a local data base in psql to test.</li>
  <li>make relation to database as er diagram.</li>
  <li>create a data in bit.io.</li>
  <li>connect data base in bit.io to real react page.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bonus</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do an authen.</li>
  <li>create dashboard for POS app.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code Explain</h2>
All code we write we all so hava psudo code to explain insid but here is some of them

<h3>What would you do differently?</h3>

<p>The most interesting thing in my team decise to pay attion to is dev too : "react ant design". It is an React UI library antd that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.
 what ant design present is
