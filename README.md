<h2>My Planing Step</h2>


<h3>1. List All requirement and draw a Wireframe</h3>
Let's thingking about what user want from POS throught User Stories 

<h3> User Stories </h3>

<ul>
  <li>As a User I want to have an account for my store *Note User repersent shop owner who use POS system</li>
  <li>As a User I want my app to have two main page such as order page and table page or more</li>
  <li>As a User I want to have  a menu page to select and create order for my custommer.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my menu page able to edit and delete my order detail.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my menu page able select Table number</li>
  <li>As a User I want to view all menu that sent from database.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my menu filtered by cattagory.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my table page to be click able and show order detail for each table</li>
  <li>As a user I want to check out my app can update status to data base </li>
  <li>As a POS App I want ability to search by menu name.</li> 
  <li>As a POS App I want ability to create and update data from database </li>  
</ul>

<h3> Wireframe </h3>
  We sperate in two part for wire frame
  
  <p>part 1 Front end wire frame, at first we submit a drawing wire frame and compaer to other POS for refferent</p>

<h3>2. make a List of technical difficulties and study all of them</h3>

<ul>
  <li>sequelize</li>
  <li>node js</li>
  <li>git comman</li>
  <li>html, css,  java script</li>
  <li>react</li>
  <li>react ant design</li>
  <li>react spinner</li>
  <li>psql</li>
  <li>figma</li>

</ul>
<h3>3. make a simple step plan</h3>

Spilt into two team one on my team do frontend other do a database and sequelize in backend


<h4>Front POS react app</h4>

Order page, Table page, Login page ,and bonus dashboard page

<p>connect data base in bit.io to real react page.</p>

<h4>Bonus</h4>
<p>Do an authen.</p>
<p>create dashboard for POS app.</p>
